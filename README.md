# jukectl

the Rust edition of a lean, UNIX philosophy(ish) utility that uses `mpd` as the Database and Player to be your own private jukebox üîäüöÄ

a "Tag" is nothing more than a Key/Value store and a Playlist is nothing more than a Key (Playlist Name) and a set of Values (Files).

## usage

I run it via Docker, an example `docker-compose.yaml` has been provided. batteries not included. üå©Ô∏è

the JSON API is **extremely** lean and also Highly Opinionated. I've written a colorful helper CLI to interact with the daemon based on my daily needs.

additionally, because the API is so simple, it's fairly easy to glue it into other tools. here is some HomeAssistant configuration to create [RESTful Switch objects](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/switch.rest/) to control your radio stations. I use `body_off` to reset the tags to Default Jukebox settings.

```yaml
switch:
  - platform: rest
    name: Morning Radio
    resource: http://jukectl.example.com:4567/tags
    body_on: '{"any":["morning"]}'
    body_off: '{"any":["jukebox"]}'
    is_on_template: "{{ value_json.any[0] == 'morning' }}"
    headers:
      Content-Type: application/json
    verify_ssl: false
  - platform: rest
    name: Barber-Beats Radio
    resource: http://jukectl.example.com:4567/tags
    body_on: '{"any":["barber-beats"]}'
    body_off: '{"any":["jukebox"]}'
    is_on_template: "{{ value_json.any[0] == 'deep-chill' }}"
    headers:
      Content-Type: application/json
    verify_ssl: false
```

## history

what you are seeing here is actually the 3rd or 4th iteration of an idea, where each copy became progressively simpler and simpler.

* the first design was a fully fledged RubyOnRails app with Scaffolding and HTML and data stored in MySQL; the works.
* * but Rails got slow so ... (`n+1` template bugs mainly)
* * I have memories of trying JRuby and even being excited that the JVM offered me an all-in-one packaging solution that Rails did not...

* I decided to try my hand in Sinatra, still using ActiveRecord and an entire Database and HTML templates.
* * but development was still slow; often because I needed to make _entire_ HTML templates where a small JSON response would do
* * and I had lots of bugs and complexity related to Database State differening from MPD's database.

I think there were some other experiments along the way, lost to time and the fog of memory.

eventually I was struck by an idea to make it even leaner; leaner than I'd ever thought possible! üßô

* Sinatra
* * with JSON input and output only!
* * no Database, only MPD as the backend!

under the hood, a `Tag` is just a `.m3u` playlist that MPD reads and `jukectl` can do the Set() operations in-memory :)

since the switch over to Sinatra+JSON+mpd-as-database, `jukectl` has served me dutifully on a near daily basis for years now :)

in my quest to port everything to Rust, I've finally re-written `jukectl` one more time in:

* Rust + Rocket
* * nearly identical API and responses as `ruby-jukectl`
* * opportunities to extend / improve / de-cruft in a Modern language

even earlier, I was inspired by https://github.com/agius/HackerMusic as well as moving from a spinning-disk iPod to a SmartPhone and needing to stream my music library on the go...

TODO:

merge jukectl-cli into this project so I can package and release everything at once

document how to fire the containerized ncurses CLI (which I haven't finished installing / wrapping up)

add environment var for default json tags
  maybe encode in base64 lololol
```
